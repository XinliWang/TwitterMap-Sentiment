# TwitterMap-Sentiment
●	Use the Amazon SQS service to create a processing queue for the Tweets that are delivered by the Twitter Streaming API
●	Use Amazon SNS service to update the status processing on each tweet so the UI can refresh.
●	Integrate a third party cloud service API into the Tweet processing flow.

For this project I develop an application that:
●	Reads a stream of tweets from the Twitter Live API (Code provided). Note: you might follow a specific topic on the API or get the complete stream
●	Records the tweet ID, time, and other relevant elements into a DB (SQL)
●	After the tweet is recorded in the DB send a message to the Queue for Asynchronous processing on the text of the tweet 
●	Presents the Tweet in a map that is being updated in Near Real Time (Consider evaluating WebSockets, or Server Side Events for your implementation)
●	The map clusters tweets as to show where is people tweeting the most, according to the sample tweets you get from the streaming API.
●	Define a worker pool that will pick up messages from the queue to process. These workers should each run on a separate pool thread.
●	Make a call to the sentiment API off your preference (e.g. Alchemy). This can return a positive or negative sentiment evaluation for the text of the submitted Tweet. 
●	As soon as the tweet is processed send a notification -using SNS- to an HTTP endpoint that will update the UI with the new information about the Tweet. 
●	Using this information your application should display the Tweet clusters and the overall sentiment.
